## Development

### Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn lint`

Runs the linger against the code-base found under the `src` folder.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `yarn deploy`

Deploys the linted and built application to Microsoft Azure.\
This requires certain access tokens and keys which can be set in the `.env` file.

#### `yarn update-certificates`

Updates the certificates used in the web application to verify the signature of the CBOR Web Tokens.

This currently fetches the EU certificates from the Austrian government and enriches the data with a \
3rd party source containing the UK certificates.

Certificates currently used by the web app: https://covid-pass-verifier.com/assets/certificates.json
